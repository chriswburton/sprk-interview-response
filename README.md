# Sparkol Tech Test

I have implemented a small TypeScript React app to deliver against the 3 User Stories provided.

Here is what you need to get the app running:
```
git clone https://github.com/chriswburton/sprk-interview-response
cd sprk-interview-response
npm i
npm start
```
_It is assumed that the authentication web service we're consuming is running on localhost:3333_

I have provided tests for the key functionality:
```
npm run test
```
Any problems, let me know. Look forward to speaking soon! Thanks
